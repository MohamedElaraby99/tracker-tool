# Privacy Policy

FikraTracker is a privacy first product that keeps tracked data anonymized. It's therefore not required to mention FikraTracker in your privacy policy. FikraTracker doesn't store IP addresses or other personal identifiable information by default. It doesn't even use cookies, therefore, it doesn't need to be added to your cookie banner either.

Although, we recommend to mention FikraTracker in your privacy policy. Let your visitors know that you're using a privacy friendly analytics tool which doesn't collect personal identifiable information.

> ⚠️ Make sure to ask your users before activating the `detailed` mode of FikraTracker. The detailed mode tracks more data and also includes data [we're considering as personal data](Anonymization.md#personal-data). In this case it's highly recommended to add FikraTracker to your privacy policy.
